shadow
======

General:
Shadow is a script that works with Mysql to gather data and interact with game servers

Shadow is written and tested with StarMade in mind but will be flexible enough to use with other game servers as well.  It is designed to allow modification to game servers without changing or modifying the server.  It works by collecting the standard and error outputs of a server and issuing admin commands to the console.


Current Goals (feel free to edit/add):
Create installer that will detect dependancies and install mysql database or use an existing DB

Move all old text files to tables inside the database

Create am easy way to edit the database

Create some sort of web interface, for editing player data and maybe display things like players stats; kills etc
